1	int -- cabin -- night (1946) 

	a dark, empty room. 

	the door bursts open. a man and woman enter, drunk and 
	giggling, horny as hell. no sooner is the door shut than 
	they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
	flesh, mouths locked together. 

	he gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
	instead. hell with it. he's got more urgent things to do, like 
	getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. she 
	arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. he slams her against 
	the wall, ripping her skirt. we hear fabric tear. 

	he enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 
	wall. she cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 
	caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 
	the sensations running through her. he carries her across the 
	room with her legs wrapped around him. they fall onto the bed. 

	camera pulls back, exiting through the window, traveling 
	smoothly outside...

	...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the 
	lovers' cries spilling into the night... 

	...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting 
	passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of 
	crickets and hoot owls... 

	...and we begin to hear faint music in the woods, tinny and
	incongruous, and still we keep pulling back until... 

	...a car is revealed. a 1946 plymouth. parked in a clearing. 

3	int -- plymouth -- night (1946) 3

	andy dufresne, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. 
	under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly
	dangerous, perhaps even meek. but these circumstances are far 
	from normal. he is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. a 
	cigarette smolders in his mouth. his eyes, flinty and hard, are 
	riveted to the bungalow up the path. 

	he can hear them fucking from here. 

	he raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. the radio 
	plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: 

		you stepped out of a dream... 
		you are too wonderful... 
		to be what you seem... 

	he opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped
	in a rag. he lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --

	-- revealing a .38 revolver. oily, black, evil. 

	he grabs a box of bullets. spills them everywhere, all over 
	the seats and floor. clumsy. he picks bullets off his lap, 
	loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. 
	six in the chamber. his gaze goes back to the bungalow. 

	he shuts off the radio. abrupt silence, except for the distant 
	lovers' moans. he takes another shot of bourbon courage, then 
	opens the door and steps from the car. 

4	ext -- plymouth -- night (1946) 4

	his wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. loose bullets scatter to 
	the ground. the bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 

	he starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. the closer he 
	gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. louder and more 
	frenzied. the lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 
	passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. 

				woman (o.s.) 
		oh god...oh god...oh god... 

	andy lurches to a stop, listening. the woman cries out in 
	orgasm. the sound slams into andy's brain like an icepick. he 
	shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. 

	it finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left 
	is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. we hear 
	languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. 

				woman (o.s.) 
		oh god...that's sooo good...you're 
		the best...the best i ever had... 

	andy just stands and listens, devastated. he doesn't look like 
	much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt 
	path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 
	held loosely at his side. a pathetic figure, really.

	pale-faced and stupefied. 

				d.a. (o.s.) 
		mr. dufresne, describe the 
		confrontation you had with your 
		wife the night she was murdered. 

	andy dufresne 

	is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 
	hair meticulously combed. he speaks in soft, measured tones: 

				andy 
		it was very bitter. she said she 
		was glad i knew, that she hated all 
		the sneaking around. she said she 
		wanted a divorce in reno. 

				d.a. 
		what was your response? 

				andy 
		i told her i would not grant one. 

				d.a. 
			(refers to his notes) 
		i'll see you in hell before i see
		you in reno. those were the words 
		you used, mr. dufresne, according 
		to the testimony of your neighbors. 

				andy 
		if they say so. i really don't 
		remember. i was upset. 

	fade to black: 2nd title up 

				d.a. 
		what happened after you and your 
		wife argued? 

				andy 
		she packed a bag and went to stay 
		with mr. quentin. 

				d.a. 
		glenn quentin. the golf pro at the 
		falmouth hills country club. the 
		man you had recently discovered was 
		her lover. 
			(andy nods) 
		did you follow her? 

				andy 
		i went to a few bars first. later, 
		i decided to drive to mr. quentin's 
		home and confront them. they 
		weren't there...so i parked my car 
		in the turnout...and waited. 

				d.a. 
		with what intention? 

				andy 
		i'm not sure. i was confused. drunk. 
		i think mostly i wanted to scare them. 

				d.a. 
		you had a gun with you? 

				andy 
		yes. i did. 

	fade to black: 3rd title up 

				d.a. 
		when they arrived, you went up 
		to the house and murdered them? 

				andy 
		no. i was sobering up. i realized 
		she wasn't worth it. i decided to 
		let her have her quickie divorce. 

				d.a. 
		quickie divorce indeed. a .38 
		caliber divorce, wrapped in a 
		handtowel to muffle the shots, 
		isn't that what you mean? and then 
		you shot her lover! 

				andy 
		i did not. i got back in the car 
		and drove home to sleep it off. 
		along the way, i stopped and threw 
		my gun into the royal river. i feel 
		i've been very clear on this point. 

				d.a. 
		yes, you have. where i get hazy, 
		though, is the part where the 
		cleaning woman shows up the next 
		morning and finds your wife and her 
		lover in bed, riddled with .38 
		caliber bullets. does that strike 
		you as a fantastic coincidence, mr. 
		dufresne, or is it just me? 

				andy 
			(softly) 
		yes. it does. 

				d.a. 
		i'm sorry, mr. dufresne, i don't 
		think the jury heard that. 

				andy 
		yes. it does. 

				d.a. 
		does what? 

				andy 
		strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 

				d.a. 
		on that, sir, we are in accord... 

	fade to black! 4th title uP 

				d.a. 
		you claim you threw your gun into 
		the royal river before the murders 
		took place. that's rather convenient. 

				andy 
		it's the truth. 

				d.a. 
		you recall lt. mincher's testimony? 
		he and his men dragged that river 
		for three days and nary a gun was 
		found. so no comparison can be made 
		between your gun and the bullets 
		taken from the bloodstained corpses 
		of the victims. that's also rather 
		convenient, isn't it, mr. dufresne? 

				andy 
			(faint, bitter smile) 
		since i am innocent of this crime, 
		sir, i find it decidedly inconvenient 
		the gun was never found.

	the d.a. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:

				d.a. 
		ladies and gentlemen, you've heard 
		all the evidence, you know all the 
		facts. we have the accused at the 
		scene of the crime. we have foot 
		prints. tire tracks. bullets 
		scattered on the ground which bear 
		his fingerprints. a broken bourbon 
		bottle, likewise with fingerprints. 
		most of all, we have a beautiful 
		young woman and her lover lying 
		dead in each other's arms. they had 
		sinned. but was their crime so 
		great as to merit a death sentence? 

	he gestures to andy sitting quietly with his attorney. 

				d.a. 
		i suspect mr. dufresne's answer to 
		that would be yes. i further 
		suspect he carried out that 
		sentence on the night of september 
		21st, this year of our lord, 1946, 
		by pumping four bullets into his 
		wife and another four into glenn 
		quentin. and while you think about 
		that, think about this... 

	he picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
	like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. 

				d.a. 
		a revolver holds six bullets, not 
		eight. i submit to you this was not 
		a hot-blooded crime of passion! 
		that could at least be understood, 
		if not condoned. no, this was 
		revenge of a much more brutal and 
		cold-blooded nature. consider! four 
		bullets per victim! not six shots 
		fired, but eight! that means he 
		fired the gun empty...and then 
		stopped to reload so he could shoot 
		each of them again! an extra bullet 
		per lover...right in the head. 
			(a few jurors shiver) 
		i'm done talking. you people are 
		all decent, god-fearing christian 
		folk. you know what to do.

		you strike me as a particularly icy

		you to serve two life sentences,

		you feel you've been rehabilitated?

		yes, sir. absolutely. i've learned 
		my lesson. i can honestly say i'm a 
		changed man. i'm no longer a danger

	red emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 
	activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
	minor business. he's an important man here. 

				red (v.o.) 
		there's a con like me in every prison 
		in america, i guess. i'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. cigarettes, a 
		bag of reefer if you're partial, a 
		bottle of brandy to celebrate your 
		kid's high school graduation. damn 
		near anything, within reason.

	forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 
	under the barrage of jeers and shouts. the old-timers are 
	shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 
	pants. some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 
	terrified. especially andy. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i must admit i didn't think much of 
		andy first time i laid eyes on him. 
		he might'a been important on the 
		outside, but in here he was just a 
		little turd in prison grays. looked 
		like a stiff breeze could blow him 
		over. that was my first impression 
		of the man. 

				skeet 
		what say, red?

	man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. 
	hadley takes his place at norton's side again. softly:

		any other questions? 
			(there are none)

	red waits at the bars. smoking. listening. he cranes his head,
	peers down toward andy's cell. nothing. not a peep. 

				heywood (o.s.) 
		fat-ass...oh, faaaat-ass. talk to

27	int -- fat-ass' cell -- night (1947) 27

	fat-ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. 

				heywood (o.s.) 
		this ain't such a bad place. i'll 
		introduce you around, make you feel 
		right at home. i know some big ol' 
		bull queers who'd love to make your 
		acquaintance...especially that big 
		white mushy butt of yours... 

	and that's it. fat-ass lets out a loud wail of despair: 

				fat-ass 
		oh god! i don't belong here! i 
		wanna go home! 

28	int -- heywood's cell -- night (1947) 28

29	int -- cellblock -- night (1947) 29

	the place goes nuts. fat-ass throws himself screaming against
	the bars. the entire block starts chanting: 

				voices 
		fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh 
		fish...fresh fish... 

				fat-ass 
		i wanna go home! i want my mother.' 

				voice (o.s.) 
		i had your mother! she wasn't that 
		great! 

	the lights bump on. guards pour in, led by hadley himself.

				hadley 
		what the christ is this happy shit? 

				voice (o.s.) 
		he took the lord's name in vain! 
		i'm tellin' the warden! 

				hadley 
			(to the unseen wit) 
		you'll be tellin' him with my baton 
		up your ass! 

	hadley arrives at fat-ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:

				hadley 
		what's your malfunction you fat 
		fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk? 

				fat-ass 
		please! this ain't right! i ain't 
		supposed to be here! not me! 

				hadley 
		i ain't gonna count to three! not 
		even to one! now shut the fuck up 
		'fore i sing you a lullabye! 

	fat-ass keeps blubbering and wailing. total freak-out. hadley 
	draws his baton, gestures to his men. open it. 

	a guard unlocks the cell. hadley pulls fat-ass out and starts 
	beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. fat-ass 
	falls, tries to crawl. 

	the place goes dead silent. all we hear now is the dull
	thwack-thwack-thwack of the baton. fat-ass passes out. hadley
	gets in a few more licks and finally stops. 

				hadley 
		get this tub of shit down to the 
		infirmary. 
			(peers around) 
		if i hear so much as a mouse fart 
		in here the rest of the night, by 
		god and sonny jesus, you'll all 
		visit the infirmary. every last

	the guards wrestle fat-ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. 
	footsteps echo away. lights off. darkness again. silence. 

30	int -- red's cell -- night (1947) 30

	red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes 
	riveted to the small puddle of blood where fat-ass went down.

31	int -- cellblock five -- morning (1947) 31

	loud buzzer. the master locks are thrown -- ka-thump! the cons 
	step from their cells, lining the tiers. the guards holler 
	their head-counts to the head bull, who jots on a clipboard. 
	red peers at andy, checking him out. andy stands in line, 
	collar buttoned, hair combed. 

32	int -- mess hall -- morning (1947) 32

	andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on
	his tray. we pan andy through the noise and confusion...and 
	discover bogs diamond and rooster macbride watching andy go 
	by. bogs sizes andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 
	mutters something to rooster. rooster laughs. 

	andy finds a table occupied by red and his regulars, chooses
	a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. ignoring their 
	stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something
	in his food. he carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 

	it's a squirming maggot. andy grimaces, unsure what to do with
	it. brooks hatlen is sitting closest to andy. at age 65, he's
	a senior citizen, a long-standing resident. 

				brooks 
		you gonna eat that? 

				andy 
		hadn't planned on it. 

				brooks 
		you mind? 

	andy passes the maggot to brooks. brooks examines it, rolling
	it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 
	cigar. andy is riveted with apprehension. 

				brooks 
		mmm. nice and ripe. 

	andy can't bear to watch. brooks opens up his sweater and 
	feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.
	andy breathes a sigh of relief. 

				brooks 
		jake says thanks. fell out of his 
		nest over by the plate shop. i'm 
		lookin' after him till he's old 
		enough to fly. 

	andy nods, proceeds to eat. carefully. heywood approaches.

				jigger 
		oh, christ, here he comes. 

				heywood 
		mornin', boys. it's a fine mornin'. 
		you know why it's fine? 

	heywood plops his tray down, sits. the men start pulling out
	cigarettes and handing them down. 

				heywood 
		that's right, send 'em all down. i 
		wanna see 'em lined up in a row, 
		pretty as a chorus line. 

	an impressive pile forms. heywood bends down and inhales
	deeply, smelling the aroma. rapture. 

				floyd 
		smell my ass... 

				heywood 
		gee, red. terrible shame, your 
		horse comin' in last and all. 
		hell, i sure do love that horse of 
		mine. i believe i owe that boy a 
		big sloppy kiss when i see him. 

				red 
		give him some'a your cigarettes 
		instead, cheap bastard. 

				heywood 
		say tyrell, you pull infirmary duty 
		this week? how's that winnin' horse 
		of mine, anyway? 

				tyrell 
		dead. 
			(the men fall silent) 
		hadley busted his head pretty good. 
		doc already went home for the 
		night. poor bastard lay there till 
		this morning. by then... 

	he shakes his head, turns back to his food. the silence
	mounts. heywood glances around. men resume eating. softly:

				andy 
		what was his name? 

				heywood 
		what? what'd you say? 

				andy 
		i was wondering if anyone knew his 
		name. 

				heywood 
		what the fuck you care, new fish? 
			(resumes eating) 
		doesn't matter what his fuckin' 
		name was. he's dead. 

33	int -- prison laundry -- day (1947) 33

	a deafening noise of industrial washers and presses. andy works
	the laundry line. a nightmarish job. he's new at it. bob, the
	con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done. 

34	int -- showers -- day (1947) 34

	shower heads mounted in bare concrete. andy showers with a
	dozen or more men. no modesty here. at least the water is good
	and hot, soothing his tortured muscles. 

	bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking andy up
	and down. rooster and pete appear from the sides. the sisters.

				bogs 

	you're some sweet punk. you been 
	broke in yet? 

	andy tries to step past them. he gets shoved around, nothing
	serious, just some slap and tickle. jackals sizing up prey.

				bogs 
		hard to get. i like that. 

	andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. he hurries off, leaving
	the three sisters laughing. 

35	int -- andy's cell -- night (1947) 35

	andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. 

36	ext -- exercise yard -- day (1947) 36

	exercise period. red plays catch with heywood and jigger, 
	lazily tossing a baseball around. red notices andy off to the
	side. nods hello. andy takes this as a cue to amble over. 
	heywood and jigger pause, watching. 

				andy 
			(offers his hand) 
		hello. i'm andy dufresne. 

	red glances at the hand, ignores it. the game continues.

				red 
		the wife-killin' banker. 

				andy 
		how do you know that? 

				red 
		i keep my ear to the ground. why'd 
		you do it? 

				andy 
		i didn't, since you ask. 

				red 
		hell, you'll fit right in, then. 
			(off andy's look) 
		everyone's innocent in here, don't 
		you know that? heywood! what are 
		you in for, boy? 

				heywood 
		didn't do it! lawyer fucked me! 

	red gives andy a look. see? 

				andy 
		what else have you heard? 

				red 
		people say you're a cold fish. they 
		say you think your shit smells 
		sweeter than ordinary. that true? 


				andy 
		what do you think? 

				red 
		ain't made up my mind yet. 

	heywood nudges jigger. watch this. he winds up and throws the
	ball hard -- right at andy's head. andy sees it coming out of
	the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. beat. he sends
	the ball right back, zinging it into heywood's hands. heywood
	drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 

				andy 
		i understand you're a man who knows 
		how to get things. 

				red 
		i'm known to locate certain things 
		from time to time. they seem to 
		fall into my hands. maybe it's 
		'cause i'm irish. 

				andy 
		i wonder if you could get me a 
		rock-hammer? 

				red 
		what is it and why? 

				andy 
		you make your customers' motives a 
		part of your business? 


				red 
		if you wanted a toothbrush, i 
		wouldn't ask questions. i'd just 
		quote a price. a toothbrush, see, 
		is a non-lethal sort of object. 

				andy 
		fair enough. a rock-hammer is about 
		eight or nine inches long. looks 
		like a miniature pickaxe, with a 
		small sharp pick on one end, and a 
		blunt hammerhead on the other. it's 
		for rocks. 

				red 
		rocks. 

	andy squats, motions red to join him. andy grabs a handful of
	dirt and sifts it through his hands. he finds a pebble and
	rubs it clean. it has a nice milky glow. he tosses it to red.

				red 
		quartz? 

				andy 
		quartz, sure. and look. mica. shale. 
		silted granite. there's some graded 
		limestone, from when they cut this 
		place out of the hill. 

				red 
		so? 

				andy 
		i'm a rockhound. at least i was, in 
		my old life. i'd like to be again, 
		on a limited scale. 

				red 
		yeah, that or maybe plant your toy 
		in somebody's skull? 

				andy 
		i have no enemies here. 

				red 
		no? just wait. 

	red flicks his gaze past andy. bogs is watching them. 

				red 
		word gets around. the sisters have 
		taken a real shine to you, yes they 
		have. especially bogs. 

				andy 
		tell me something. would it help if 
		i explained to them i'm not 
		homosexual? 

				red 
		neither are they. you have to be 
		human first. they don't qualify. 
			(off andy's look) 
		bull queers take by force, that's 
		all they want or understand. i'd 
		grow eyes in the back of my head if 
		i were you. 

				andy 
		thanks for the advice. 

				red 
		that comes free. but you understand 
		my concern. 

				andy 
		if there's trouble, i doubt a rock- 
		hammer will do me any good. 

				red 
		then i guess you wanna escape. 
		tunnel under the wall maybe? 
			(andy laughs politely) 
		i miss the joke. what's so funny? 

				andy 

	you'll know when you see the rock- 
	hammer. 

				red 
		what's this item usually go for? 

				andy 
		seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

				red 
		my standard mark-up's twenty 
		percent, but we're talkin' about a 
		special object. risk goes up, price 
		goes up. call it ten bucks even. 

				andy 
		ten it is. 

				red 
		i'll see what i can do. 
			(rises, slapping dust) 
		but it's a waste of money. 

				andy 
		oh? 

				red 
		folks who run this place love 
		surprise inspections. they turn a 
		blind eye to some things, but not 
		a gadget like that. they'll find 
		it, and you'll lose it. mention my 
		name, we'll never do business 
		again. not for a pair of shoelaces 
		or a stick of gum. 

				andy 
		i understand. thank you, mr...? 

				red 
		red. the name's red. 

				andy 
		red. i'm andy. pleasure doing 
		business with you. 

	they shake. andy strolls off. red watches him go. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i could see why some of the boys 
		took him for snobby. he had a quiet 
		way about him, a walk and a talk 
		that just wasn't normal around 
		here. he strolled. like a man in a 
		park without a care or worry. like 
		he had on an invisible coat that 
		would shield him from this place. 
			(resumes playing catch) 
		yes, i think it would be fair to 
		say i liked andy from the start. 

37	int -- mess hall -- day (1947) 37

	step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper. 

38	int -- red's cell -- night (1947) 38

39	ext -- loading dock -- day (1947) 39

	under watchful supervision, cons are off-loading bags of dirty
	laundry from an "eliot nursing home" truck. 

				red (v.o.) 
		years later, i found out he'd 
		brought in quite a bit more than 
		just ten dollars... 

	a certain bag hits the ground. the truck driver shoots a look 
	at a black con, leonard, then ambles over to a guard to shoot 
	the shit. leonard loads the bag onto a cart... 

40	int -- prison laundry -- day (1947) 40

	bags are being unloaded. we find leonard working the line. 

				red (v.o.) 
		when they check you into this

		you over and looks up your works, 
		just to make sure you're not 
		carrying anything. but a truly 
		determined man can get an object 
		quite a ways up there. 

	leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry 
	bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... 

4l	int -- prison laundry exchange -- day (1947) 41

	red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where 
	the clean sheets are being handed out. 

				red (v.o.) 
		that's how andy joined our happy 
		little shawshank family with more 
		than five hundred dollars on his 
		person. determination. 

	leonard catches red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of 
	clean sheets. he hands it across to red -- 

	tight angle 

	-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. two packs of
	cigarettes slide out of red's hand into leonard's. 

42	int -- red's cell -- day (1947) 42

	red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to 
	make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. he pulls out the 
	rock-hammer. it's just as andy described. red laughs softly. 

				red (v.o.) 
		andy was right. i finally got the 
		joke. it would take a man about six 
		hundred years to tunnel under the 
		wall with one of these. 

43	int -- cellblock five -- 2nd tier -- night (1947) 43

	brooks hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. the 
	rolling library. he finds red waiting for him. red slips the 
	rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the
	cart. next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. 

				red 

	dufresne. 

	brooks nods, never missing a beat. he rolls his cart to 
	andy's cell, mutters through the bars: 

				brooks 
		middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 

	andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object 
	disappear. the hand comes back and deposits a small slip of 
	folded paper along with more cigarettes. brooks turns his cart
	around and goes back. he pauses, sorting his books long enough
	for red to snag the slip of paper. brooks continues on, 
	scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket. 

44	int -- red's cell -- night (1947) 44

	andy is doing his job, getting good at it. 

				bob 
		dufresne! we're low on hexlite! 
		head on back and fetch us up some! 

	andy nods. he leaves the line, weaving his way through the 
	laundry room and into -- 

46	int -- back rooms/stock area -- day (1947) 46

	-- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and
	furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of 
	cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. andy hefts a 
	cardboard drum of hexlite off the stack, turns around -- 

	-- and finds bogs diamond in the aisle. blocking his way.
	rooster looms from the shadows to his right, pete verness
	on the left. a frozen beat. andy slams the hexlite to the
	floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful.

				andy 
		you get this in your eyes, it 
		blinds you. 

				bogs 
		honey, hush. 

	andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through 
	the maze. the sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes 
	riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. 
	andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. that's all it takes. 
	they're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. 

	andy gets yanked to his feet. bogs applies a chokehold from 
	behind. they propel him across the room and slam him against 
	an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. rooster jams 
	a rag into andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like 
	a horse bit. andy kicks and struggles, but rooster and pete 
	have his arms firmly pinned. bogs whispers in andy's ear: 

				bogs 
		that's it, fight. better that way. 

	andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. camera pulls back, 
	slowly widening. the big washex blocks our view. all we see 
	is andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... 

	...and camera drifts from the room, leaving the dark place 
	and the dingy act behind...moving up empty corridors, past 
	concrete walls and steel pipes...

	we emerge into the prison laundry past a guard, widening for 
	a final view of the line. the giant steel "mangler" is 
	slapping down in brutal rhythm. the sound is deafening.

50 	andy backs into a corner in some dingy part of the prison, 
	wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. 

				red (v.o.)

		remember. he fought because he knew 
		if he didn't fight, it would make

		oh. hadn't thought of that.

		pay tax on the car. repairs and

				mert 
		and drive it, if they're old enough. 

				hadley 
		that's right, wanting to drive it,

		then at the end of the year, if you 
		figured the tax wrong, they make

	the guards stiffen at andy's approach. youngblood's hand goes
	to his holster. the tower guards click-clack their rifle 
	bolts. hadley turns, stupefied to find andy there. 

				andy 
		mr. hadley. do you trust your wife? 

				Hadley 
		that's funny. you're gonna look 
		funnier suckin' my dick with no 
		fuckin' teeth. 

				andy 
		what i mean is, do you think she'd 
		go behind your back? try to 
		hamstring you? 

				hadley 
		that's it! step aside, mert. this 
		fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 

	hadley grabs andy's collar and propels him violently toward
	the edge of the roof. the cons furiously keep spreading tar.

				heywood 
		oh god, he's gonna do it, he's 
		gonna throw him off the roof... 

				snooze 
		oh shit, oh fuck, oh jesus... 

				andy 
		because if you do trust her, there's 
		no reason in the world you can't 
		keep every cent of that money. 

	hadley abruptly jerks andy to a stop right at the edge. in 
	fact, andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips 
	scraping the roof. the only thing between him and an ugly drop
	to the concrete is hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.

				hadley 
		you better start making sense. 

				andy 
		if you want to keep that money, all 
		of it, just give it to your wife. 
		see, the irs allows you a one-time- 
		only gift to your spouse. it's good 
		up to sixty thousand dollars. 

				hadley 
		naw, that ain't right! tax free? 

				andy 
		tax free. irs can't touch one cent. 

	the cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.

				hadley 
		you're the smart banker what shot 
		his wife. why should i believe a 
		smart banker like you? so's i can 
		wind up in here with you? 

				andy 
		it's perfectly legal. go ask the 
		irs, they'll say the same thing. 
		actually, i feel silly telling you 
		all this. i'm sure you would have 
		investigated the matter yourself. 

				hadley 
		fuckin'-a. i don't need no smart 
		wife-killin' banker to show me where 
		the bear shit in the buckwheat. 

				andy 
		of course not. but you will need 
		somebody to set up the tax-free 
		gift, and that'll cost you. a 
		lawyer, for example... 

				hadley 
		ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing 
		cocksuckers! 

				andy 
		...or come to think of it, i 
		suppose i could set it up for you. 
		that would save you some money. 
		i'll write down the forms you need, 
		you can pick them up, and i'll 
		prepare them for your signature... 
		nearly free of charge. 
			(off hadley's look) 
		i'd only ask three beers apiece for 
		my co-workers, if that seems fair. 

				trout 
			(guffawing) 
		co-workers! get him! that's rich, 
		ain't it? co-workers... 

	hadley freezes him with a look. andy presses on: 

				andy 
		i think a nan working outdoors 
		feels more like a man if he can 
		have a bottle of suds. that's only 
		my opinion. 

	the convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. they
	look like they've been pole-axed. hadley shoots them a look.

				heyWood 
			(approaches with a beer) 
		here's a cold one, andy. 

				andy 
		no thanks. i gave up drinking.

				red (v.o.) 
		you could argue he'd done it to 
		curry favor with the guards. or

		that'd take you years.

				andy 
		they'd never hear me over that. 
		let's get this over with. 

	seemingly resigned, andy turns around, leans on the rewind 
	bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel
	of 35mm film. rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.

				rooster 
		me first. 

				andy 
		okay. 

	andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing
	it into rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. 

				rooster 
		fuck! shit! he broke my nose! 

	andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his
	knees. bogs steps to andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 
	eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it. 

				bogs 
		now i'm gonna open my fly, and 
		you're gonna swallow what i give 
		you to swallow. and when you 
		d mine, you gonna swallow 
		rooster's. you done broke his nose, 
		so he ought to have somethin' to 
		show for it. 

				andy 
		anything you put in my mouth, 
		you're going to lose. 

				bogs 
		you don't understand. you do that, 
		i'll put all eight inches of this 
		steel ii your ear. 

				andy 
		okay. but you should know that 
		sudden serious brain injury causes 
		the victim to bite down. hard. 
			(faint smile) 
		in fact, i understand the bite-reflex 
		is so strong the victim's jaws have 
		to be pried open with a crowbar. 

	the sisters consider this carefully. the film runs out of the 
	projector, flapping on the reel. the screen goes white. 

				bogs 
		you little fuck. 

	andy gets a bootheel in the face. the sisters start kicking 
	and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can 
	get their hands on. in the theater, the convicts are chanting 
	and clapping for the movie to come back on.

	echoes dimly over the p.a. system: 

				voice (o.s.) 
		return to your cellblocks for 
		evening count. 

	bogs enters his cell. dark in here. he fumbles for the light 
	cord, yanks it. the sudden light reveals captain hadley six 
	inches from his face, waiting for him. mert steps in behind 
	bogs. hemming him. 

	before bogs can even open his mouth to say "what the fuck," 
	hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar 
	plexus. bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out.

	cart loaded with supplies.

	hearing strange thumping sounds. what the hell is that? 

72 	3rd tier 72

	with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good 
	measure. he feebly tries to ward them off. 

73 	2nd tier 73

	puzzled, red steps from his cell, following the sound. it 
	dawns on him that it's coming from above. he moves to the 
	railing and leans out, craning around to look up -- 

74 	red's pov 74

	-- just as bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing

	directly toward us, eyes bugging out, screaming as he falls. 

75 	red (slow motion) 75

	jumps back as bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms 
	swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that 
	too), screaming aaaaalll the way down -- 

76 	ground floor 76

	-- and impacting on ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous 
	eruption of solvents and cleansers. the cart is squashed flat, 
	shooting out from under bogs and skidding across the cellblock 
	floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. 
	ernie is left gaping in shock at bogs and all the bogs-related 
	wreckage at his feet. 

77 	2nd tier 77

	red is stunned. he very tentatively leans out and looks up. 
	above him, hadley and mert lean on the 3rd tier railing. 
	hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head. 

				mert 
		damn, byron. look'a that. 

				hadley 
		poor fella must'a tripped. 

	a tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of hadley's shoe and 

	splashes across red's upturned cheek. he wipes it off, then 
	looks down at bogs. cons and guards are racing to the scene.

	rolled poster. he lets it uncurl to the floor. a small scrap 
	of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. the poster is the
	famous rita hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes
	half closed, sulky lips parted. andy picks up the scrap of

				ernie 
		heads up. they're tossin' cells. 

	word travels fast from cell to cell. cons scramble to tidy up
	and hide things. norton enters, nods to his men. the guards 
	pair off in all directions, making their choices at random. 

				guard 
		what kind'a contraband you hiding 
		in there, boy? 

	cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, 
	mattresses overturned. whatever contraband is found gets 
	tossed out onto the cellblock floor. mostly harmless stuff.

	shoots a nasty look at the con responsible.

	he motions at andy on his bunk, reading his bible. the door is
	unlocked. norton enters, trailed by his men. andy rises. 

				andy 
		good evening. 

	norton gives a curt nod. hadley and trout start tossing the

	looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. he takes the

	andy pauses. something about this doesn't make any sense.

				andy 
		brooks? how long have you been 
		librarian? 

				brooks 
		since 1912. yuh, over 37 years. 

				andy 
		in all that time, have you ever had 
		an assistant? 

				brooks 
		never needed one. not much to it, 
		is there? 

				andy 
		so why now? why me? 

				brooks 
		i dunno. be nice to have some 
		comp'ny down here for a change. 

				hadley (o.s.)

91 	andy steps back into the outer rooms and finds hadley with 91

				hadley 
		that's him. that's the one. 

	hadley exits. dekins approaches andy ominously. andy stands 
	his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. finally: 

				dekins 
		i'm dekins. i been, uh, thinkin' 
		'bout maybe settin' up some kinda 
		trust fund for my kids' educations. 

	andy covers his surprise. glances at brooks. brooks smiles.

				andy 
		i see. well. why don't we have a 
		seat and talk it over? 

				brooks 
		pull down one'a them desks there. 

	andy and dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the
	floor. they find chairs and settle in. brooks returns with a 
	tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before andy. 

				andy 
		what did you have in mind? a weekly 
		draw on your pay? 

				dekins 
		yuh. i figured just stick it in the 
		bank, but captain hadley said check 
		with you first. 

				andy 
		he was right. you don't want your 
		money in a bank. 

				dekins 
		i don't? 

				andy 
		what's that gonna earn you? two and 
		a half, three percent a year? we 
		can do a lot better than that. 
			(wets his pen) 
		so tell me, mr. dekins. where do 
		you want to send your kids?

		actually shook andy's hand. 

				heywood 
		my ass! 

				brooks 
		shook his fuckin' hand. just about

		mister dufresne, if you please. 

				red 
		makin' yourself some friends, andy. 

				andy 
		i wouldn't say "friends." i'm a

		sound financial planning. that's a 
		wonderful pet to have. 

				red 
		got you out of the laundry, didn't 
		it? 

				andy 
		maybe it can do more than that. 
			(off their looks) 
		how about expanding the library? 
		get some new books in there. 

				heywood 
		how you 'spect to do that, "mr. 
		dufresne-if-you-please?" 

				andy 
		ask the warden for funds. 

	laughter all around. andy blinks at them. 

				brooks 
		son, i've had six wardens through 
		here during my tenure, and i have

				andy 
		i see. perhaps i could write to the

		directly from them. 

				norton 
		far as them republican boys in

		still, i'd like to try, with your

		dear mr. dufresne. in response to

		in addition, the library district

	andy nods. wiley disappears into the toilet, jughead comix in 
	hand. alone now, andy starts going through the boxes like a 
	starving man exploring packages of food. he doesn't know where 
	to turn first. he gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling 
	out books, touching them, smelling them. 

	he rips open another box. this one contains an old phonograph
	player, industrial gray and green, the words "portland public

	stacks and stacks of used record albums. 

	andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping 
	through them. used nat king coles, bing crosbys, etc.

	he slides the mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the 
	platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. the 
	needle hisses in the groove...and the music begins, lilting

		britches? feel like talking? guess 
		not. why should you be different? 

	red exchanges looks with the guards. even they're nervous. 
	norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. he hurls them at
	the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words:

				norton 
		it's a conspiracy! (smash) that's 
		what this is! (smash) it's one big 
		damn conspiracy! (smash) and 
		everyone's in on it! (smash)

	he sends the last rock whizzing right at racquel. 
	no smash. 

	it takes a moment for this to sink in. all eyes go to her. the 
	rock went through her. there's a small hole in the poster 
	where her navel used to be. 

	you could hear a pin drop. norton reaches up, sinks his finger 
	into the hole. he keeps pushing...and his entire hand 
	disappears into the wall. 

221 	angle from behind poster 221

	as norton rips the poster from before our eyes. stunned faces 
	peer in. camera pulls slowly back...to reveal the long

	withdraws, replaced by andy's peering eye. 

240 	a series of dissolves (1965 through 1966) 240

	takes us through the widening of the hole. first as big as a

				red (v.o.) 
		probably took him most of a year 
		just to get his head through. 

	andy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. he's 
	got a penlight clenched in his teeth. he peers down into the 
	shaft. at the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic 
	pipe runs the length of the cellblock. beneath its coat of 
	grime and dust, the word "sewer" is stenciled.

	he pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a 
	stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real

	andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist,
	he reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel 
	conduit with his fingers. 

	suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. andy yanks away and 
	almost plummets head-first down the shaft. he dangles wildly 
	upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his 
	hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. the rat 
	scurries off, pissed. 

	andy snags the conduit again. he contorts out of the hole and
	dangles into the shaft. we now see the purpose for the rope: the
	plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,

	the door opens. red exits with his bag and heads down the 
	stairs, leaving the door open. camera pushes through, booming 
	up to the ceiling beam which reads: "brooks hatlen was here." 

	a new message has been carved alongside the old: "so was red."

	a gorgeous new england landscape whizzes by, fields and trees 
	a blur of motion. angle shifts to reveal a greyhound sceni- 
	cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. camera 
	travels from window to window, passing faces. we finally come 
	to red gazing out at the passing landscape.

		sit still or hold a thought in my

		only a free man can feel, a free 
		man at the start of a long journey

				red (v.o.) 
		i hope i can make it across the

	a distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck 
	that's been left to rot in the sun. there's someone out there.

	a man is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by 
	hand, face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask. 

	red appears b.g., a distant figure walking out across the 
	sand, wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag. 

	the man on the boat pauses. turns slowly around. red arrives 
	with a smile as wide as the horizon. the other man raises his 
	goggles and pulls down his mask. andy, of course.
